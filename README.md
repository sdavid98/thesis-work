# My Thesis Work #
I wanted to create a platform, on which designers could freely build HTML emails. The result is this simple application, that can generate the proper HTML code that matches the input and at the same time works well as an email. Users can structure their email by dynamic table insertion, and they can set up the contents' design to fulfil their needs.

It's written in React with Redux on frontend, Node on backend with MongoDB storage and it's all hosted on Firebase. 

## Usage ##
In the Editor view, you can add new rows on the left. These can be cunfigured to include a custom-set number of rows and columns. After inserting it into the email's body, you can select the content type of the individual cells. The cells content and style can be configured via an inline WYSIWYG editor and/or the right panel, depending on content type.

## Note ##
The project's scope changed mid-time, meaning a more complex application with extra features has been built, instead of the desired core functionality (which is the Email Editor). This is my first bigger-scale React application, read and use carefully.
